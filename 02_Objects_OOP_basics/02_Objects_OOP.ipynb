    "\n",
    "> A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself (**objects have a notion of this or self**). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\n",
